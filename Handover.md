# Handover

For Ananya:

- Spruce up the pyproject.toml file
- Change from flake8, black and other linters to ruff
- Fix inevitable breakage from updating
- See if it can run on Python 3.13, otherwise try Python 3.12

What Jeppe would do different second time around (don't start here though, mostly hardware related)
- Use OpenBuild eco-system for mechanical parts
-
