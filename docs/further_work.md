# Further Work (To-do)

## Increase distance between magnet and ball bearing

While the current setup does work fairly reliably, the distance between the
diametrically magnetised magnet and the ferromagnetic housing of the ball bearing
on each cart would ideally be increased to allow for higher field strengths at the
rotary encoder chip.

On start-up the system prints information about the strength of the magnet and currently reports it
as below the ideal strength.
