# Introducing CartpoleML

CartpoleML is a physical experimental setup for the development and exploration
of reinforcement learning algorithms in a reproducable, accessible way.

The [OpenAI Gym] and [PettingZoo] projects have provided a standardised set of environments
for use in single and multiagent reinforcement learning, which has 
enabled the academic community to use a consistent, reproducable environment
across different papers, research groups, and organisations.
