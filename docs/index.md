# Introduction

CartpoleML is an open-source learning platform that enables the user to quickly
start experimenting with simulated and physical multi-agent reinforcement learning
projects quickly.

CartpoleML is still being actively developed and uses state-of-the-art
reinforcement-learning libraries for greater reproducibility.

## Author

The CartpoleML project is an undergraduate research project undertaken by Jeppe Klitgaard
at the Biological and Soft Systems group at Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge 
under supervision of Professor Pietro Cicuta and Professor Pietro Lio.

## Documentation overview

The documentation is incomplete and should not be taken as gospel.

It is divided into a number of categories:

- __Development__: Documentation surrounding the development of the project.  
    Useful for advanced use or further development of the platform.
- __Building__: Documentation on acquiring hardware, 3D-printing parts, and assemblying the project.
- __Usage__: Guides on how to use the platform for machine learning.
- __Articles__: A collection of articles related to the project.
- __Videos__: A collection of videos of the project in action.

## Project overview

The project consists of two main components:

- `Commander`: The Python-based codebase that runs simulations, does both learning and
    inference, and communicates with the `Controller` using a low-level networking protocol
- `Controller`: The C/C++ based codebase that runs on Arduino SAM-based (32-bit ARM) microprocessors (namely the Arduino Due). The `Controller` handles sensors, motors, and communicating with the `Commander` over a serial interface.


## Underlying technologies

CartpoleML uses the following underlying technologies.

### Commander

- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/): Project and package management
- [`stable_baselines3`](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/): `pytorch`-based standard implementations of common model-free
    reinforcement learning algorithms
- [`tensorboard`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard): For studying parameters and other output from the experiments
- [`pettingzoo`](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/): Standardising the multi-agent environment

### Controller

- [`platformio`](https://platformio.org/): Framework for embedded programming
