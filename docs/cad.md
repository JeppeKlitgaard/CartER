# CAD Files

The CAD has been done in Autodesk Fusion 360, which is unfortunately not very
easy to share in an open-source friendly manner.

Once downloading files from the cloud in bulk is no longer broken,
CAD dumps will be available on the GitHub page.

If you are interested in the project, please reach out to [jk782@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jk782@cam.ac.uk) in order to get access to the CAD files through Autodesk Cloud.

The main assembly file can be found here: [Full Construction](https://a360.co/2TN4MXv)
